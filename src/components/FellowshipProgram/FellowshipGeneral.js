          College ARCH's summer fellowship is a 4-week FREE program where
          fellows attend two virtual workshops (over zoom) each week to learn
          about the college application process, get paired with a college
          mentor (from Harvard, Yale, Princeton, MIT, and other colleges) and
          will also receive additional resources during the 4-week programming
          to learn.
