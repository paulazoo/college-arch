          The College Key Foundation's summer fellowship is a 4-week FREE
          program where fellows attend two virtual workshops (over zoom) each
          week to learn about the college application process, get paired with a
          college mentor (from Harvard, Yale, Princeton, MIT, and other
          colleges) and will also receive additional resources during the 4-week
          programming to learn.
