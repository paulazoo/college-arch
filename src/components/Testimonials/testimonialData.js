Today I feel free to say that I'm in the right path to my goal. You shared with us college essay writing experiences and despite all my doubts, I have practicing with all your resources, the diagnostic exam and re-watching the SAT prep class, right now I'm really happy because I received all the support of my mentor... Thanks for creating this program, I hope you can still grow and share all this knowledge all over the world!",
